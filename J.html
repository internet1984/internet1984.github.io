This latest release of Jekyll includes a slew of enhancements and bug fixes. Some of the highlights:

Strange bug around spacing/indentation should be resolved. It was a curious bug indeed.
Pages, Posts, and Drafts can now be converted by multiple converters.
Static files can now be safely included in collections. They’ll be placed in a collection.files array. collection.docs still holds exclusively content with YAML front matter.
Sass files can once again be rendered by Liquid. However, neither Sass nor CoffeeScript can ever have a layout. Bonus: scssify and sassify Liquid filters.
Partial variables allowed now in the path argument of include calls
We added a jekyll help command. Pass it a subcommand to see more info about that subcommand. Or don’t, to see the help for jekyll itself.
Lots of fixes to the site template we use for jekyll new, including converting the CSS into SCSS.
The jsonify filter will now call #to_liquid for you
Lots, lots more!
One change deserves special note. In #2633, subfolders inside a _posts folder were processed and added as categories to the posts. It turns out, this behaviour was unwanted by a large number of individuals, as it is a handy way to organize posts. Ultimately, we decided to revert this change in #2705, because it was a change in behaviour that was already well-established (at least since Jekyll v0.7.0), and was convenient.

For more excellent CHANGELOG reading material, check out the History page! Happy Jekylling!

Jekyll 2.0.3 Released

RELEASE  09 May 2014  parkr parkr
Hey again! Just wanted to let you know we’ve released another version of Jekyll, jam-packed with bug fixes.

A huge “thank you” is in order for all the folks who have submitted bug reports over the last 2 days — your input is what allows this project to continue. It’s always a pain to deal with a MAJOR version bump release, but it’s been pretty smooth so far and you have all been nice about the flaws you’ve found in the tool. Keep filing those reports so we can continue to make Jekyll even better!

Thank you to the contributors that contributed code to 2.0.1, 2.0.2, and/or 2.0.3:

Parker Moore, Yi Zeng, Gabe Ortiz, Aaron Broder, Alberto Grespan, gpxl, David Briggs, Kevin Ingersoll, and Troy Swanson.

As always, check out the changelog for more info. Happy Jekylling!

Jekyll turns 2.0.0

RELEASE  06 May 2014  parkr parkr
A year ago to the day, we released Jekyll 1.0.0. One year later, we present to you the next major version: Jekyll 2.0.0.

Jam-packed with some highly-requested features and bugfixes galore, this is the best Jekyll yet. Some notable changes:

Collections - Collections allow you to define an unlimited number of custom document types (beyond just posts and pages) for different types of content you may want to author in Jekyll such as API documentation or a cookbook!
Brand new site template (thanks @jglovier!) - Getting started with Jekyll just got a lot easier and a lot more beautiful. Just run jekyll new <path> and you’re good to go.
Native Sass & CoffeeScript support - We love CSS and JavaScript as much as the next guy, but there will always be a special place in our hearts for Sass and CoffeeScript. We now offer native support for these file types — no more messing around with Rake or Grunt!
YAML Front Matter defaults - If you’ve set layout: post more than once in your life, you’ll love this new feature: set front matter defaults for a given directory or type.
Custom markdown processors - Always wanted to use your favourite home-grown Markdown converter, but couldn’t with Jekyll? Now you can. Simply specify markdown: MyConverterClass and you’re on your way.
Addition of where and group_by Liquid filters - Simplifying your Liquid templates one filter at a time. The where filter selects from an array all items within which have a given value for a property. The group_by filter groups all items in an array which have the same value for a given property.
Switch from Maruku to Kramdown as default markdown converter - Maruku is dead. We’ve replaced it with the converter which has the closest feature parity: Kramdown!
Check out our changelog for a complete list of all (200+) changes.
